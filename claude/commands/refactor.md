description: Run refactoring checks for code quality

Run `assist refactor check $ARGUMENTS`. If it fails, fix all errors and run again until it passes.

**Important**

- Do not concatenate lines - the formatter will expand them again anyway.
- Do not remove comments unless they are clearly obsolete.
